# Givers

Givers is a web platform that allows its users to register and participate in various real world events, supported by various features such as map navigation, event chatting and a points shop. 

Project done by NovaWare for the APDC2021 course.

## Backend description

This simple backend is what takes care of user requests for the Givers platform. REST API built using Java and Maven, and hosted temporarily on Google App Engine.

The requests were split into various categories, found in the resources folder. Amongst these are included typical requests, such as user account registering and logging, and other platform targeted requests, such as creating, editing and querying "givers events", and registering new institutions, amongst others.
